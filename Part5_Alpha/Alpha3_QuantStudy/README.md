# Alpha3 - VGG16 Layer Quantization Study

## Description
This Alpha submission provides a comprehensive study of VGG16 layer-wise quantization effects and accuracy analysis.

## Structure
- `software/` - Jupyter notebook with quantization analysis

## Contents
- `Project_Part4.ipynb` - Quantization study notebook containing:
  - Layer-wise quantization sensitivity analysis
  - Accuracy vs. bit-width tradeoffs
  - Model compression results

## How to Run
1. Open `software/Project_Part4.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
2. Run all cells to reproduce the quantization analysis
